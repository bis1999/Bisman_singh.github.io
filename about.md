# 👋 Hi, I’m Bisman Singh

I’m a **mathematician, researcher, and builder** at the intersection of **quantitative finance, machine learning, and network science**.  
Currently based in the U.S., I earned my **M.S. in Applied Mathematics** from the University of Colorado Boulder and a **B.S. in Statistics & Mathematics** from the University of Delhi.

---

## 🔭 What I Work On
- **Graph Machine Learning**: Creator of **linkpredx**, a modular link prediction framework combining classical ML with GNNs and meta-learning.   
- **Automation & BI**: Experience designing large-scale **data pipelines** and analytics at **Goldman Sachs**, focusing on efficiency and reliability.  

---

## 🏆 Highlights
- 🎓 **NetSci 2024 (Montreal):** Presented research on **meta-learning for link prediction**, accepted at a leading network science conference.  
- 💡 **Boeing Scholarship:** Awarded $15,000 for research integrating satellite imagery with flight trajectory optimization.  
- 📈 **Goldman Sachs (Alt. Investments):** Analyst with hands-on experience in data reconciliation, vendor oversight, and building analytic tools.  
- 🏅 **INSPIRE–SHE Award (India):** National fellowship funding my undergraduate studies in statistics.

---

## 🚀 Current Goals
- Building a portfolio of **research blogs & experiments** that bridge **finance and ML** (check out the [Blog](/blog)).  
- Preparing for a **quant research career** — combining my strengths in applied math, probability, and statistical modeling with cutting-edge ML.  
- Designing projects that speak to **macro research, commodities, and risk analytics**, making my work both academically rigorous and market-relevant.
